1. The search() method is a mess. Compares every property of Guitar class to Guitar object in the Inventory.
2. The search is case sensitive so nothing turns up.
3. All Strings, could have constants or enums.
4. The Inventory and Guitar classes depend on each other.
5. What is great software? 
    - It does what customer wants it to. If customers try to use it in different ways, it does'nt break the software in any ways.
    - Great software is well-designed, well-coded, easy to maintain, reuse and extend.
    - Strive for a maintainable, reusable design.
