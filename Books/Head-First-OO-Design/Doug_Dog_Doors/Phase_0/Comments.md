1. DogDoor is an interface to DogDoor hardware providing open and close methods. 
2. Remote provides a pressButton() method to either close or open() the door.
3. The problem here is if the door is left open and forgotten to close, lots of rodents might come in along with the dog. Typical case of not capturing the requirements properly.
