# Introduction to Database Systems - The Why


## Utility
1. Very useful; Database processing backs every application today.
2. Data intensive is a fourth paradigm of science apart from experimental, theoratical and simulation.
3. 2000s saw the transitions to data-centric programs
4. Data centered careers

## Centrality
1. Data is at the center of modern society
2. Data is low value in isolation but valuable when aggregated.
3. Data is difficult to protect since it's fluid, very easy to copy.
4. Centre of many of the issues like data privacy, data integrity
5. The data infrastructure determines what's possible 

## Core of modern computing
1. Data growth outpaces computation
2. Systems for data at scale is at the core of modern computing.

## Forces driving data growth

1. Cheap scalable data systems
2. Ubiquitous sensors and reporting: Cameras, mobile computing and social media
3. Large collaborative data science projects
4. More Data equates to more value.
