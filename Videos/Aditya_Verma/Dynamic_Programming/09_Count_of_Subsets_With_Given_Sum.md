# Count of subsets with given sum

1. Problem: Return the count of subsets from the given array where the sum is the given sum
          arr = [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10], Sum = 10
For example: this will return 3 - [10], [2, 3, 5], [2, 8]

2. Initialization: Initialize the same matrix of size [n+1][Sum+1] i.e. 7 * 11

3. Code is similar to subset sum problem, instead of OR, please plus them.
