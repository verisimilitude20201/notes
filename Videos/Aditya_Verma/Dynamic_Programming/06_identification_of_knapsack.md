# Revisions of Knapsack and Identification

1. We had been given following arrays as properties of items
      Weight = []
      Value = []
      Maximum Capacity of Knapsack.
   Ultimately, we just have a single array of items and we have two arrays to hold the values of their two properties weight and profit. In certain problems, they can give us only one array which will be the weight array. 

2. Knapsack Pattern: Whenever we have a set of items with their weight and we have been given a capacity and need to find a maximum, it'll be a Knasack pattern.


3. Following problems are based on Knapsack
   - Subset sum problem
   - Target Sum
   - Count of Subset sum
   - Minimum Subset Sum
   - Equal Sum Partition
   - Number of subsets of given sum
