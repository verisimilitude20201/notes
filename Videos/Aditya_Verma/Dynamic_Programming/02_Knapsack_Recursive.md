# Knapsack Recursive

## Actual Problem
Given the below items and their profits, find the maximum profit obtained by inserting all of them in a Knapsack of weight 10 

               I1 I2 I3 I4
        Weight 2  3  4  5
        Value  1  4  5  7

Knapsack Weight: 10 KG

## Flow of Recursive solution
1. Think of smallest valid input for base condition
2. Prepare choice diagram
