## DP
  - Top Down approach is via a table
  - Dynamic programming is enhanced recursion. DP's parent is recursion.
  - Function calls itself with smaller sets of inputs. It keeps on reducing the input by 1. Say first call is from n. The calls at the second level of the tree are from n - 1 and n - 2
  - To avoid repeated calls, we construct the DP table.

## How to identify DP problems
  - DP problems always ask from something optimal (minimum, maximum, largest)
  - We are always given a choice. For example: we are given a knapsack amd we can either include an element or not include it.
  - Overlapping problems: Two recursive calls.

## First try to write a recursive solution, then memoize it. Then we can start with the bottom-up tabular approach. For bottom-up, recursive solution is a must.
