# Tips for your next interview

1. Clarify if it's a low-level design and high-level design
2. Ask about specific functionality that the interviewer is interested in.
3. Be clear about the non-functional requirements as well - Data size, throughput, scale.
4. Start with basic components and how they interact. 
5. Nobody expects you to know everything. Clearly say that you don't know and ask for tips/help.
