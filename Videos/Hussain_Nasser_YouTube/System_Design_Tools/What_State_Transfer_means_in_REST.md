# What Does "State Transfer" mean in REST

1. You go to a doctor for the first time, doctor understands and questions your case history and doctor documents the case, prescribes medicines and tests. We visit the doctor later on with your file, doctor recollects from the file the case history and may prescribe additional medicines. This is Stateful. 
2. In case you visit a new doctor, you need to transfer the knowledge about your case history to the new doctor for him to diagnose you. This is Stateless. Similarly, when a client approaches a server with a request, it attaches every information feasible in the request.
