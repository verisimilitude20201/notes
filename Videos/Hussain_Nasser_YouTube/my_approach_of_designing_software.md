# My approach to designing software 

1. Write whatever you are thinking about.
2. Book 2-3 hours of uninterrupted time slots
3. Use a clutter-free software(Sublime Text) to take notes. Because when you start writing, only you see what you write and nothing else
4. Write how the software will be used in detailed words. This will result in many questions for the project's stakeholders.
5. Compile the questions raised from the workflow to get a final say on the steps of the workflow for the project's stakeholders.
6. Start writing the design overview. This explains how users interact with the software and we can mention reverse proxies, configuration management systems, databases what all components can be used. Includes write ups of different components of the system, front-end back-end, databases, their workflow and interaction. Should be in sync with the non-technical functional spec
7. Async jobs/processes not having a direct user input may not be traced back to the non-technical functional spec. Because the users don't use this directly, this is fine.
8. Open each new page of the editor and start elaborating about each component - what would be the interface, what would it compute, what would it output.
9. Final pieces will draw the design connecting all components together. Just have a simple box and label it appropriately. Can be multiple diagrams of the system based on the complexity of its components.

The goal is writing in order to think. Need to articulate every possible area.
