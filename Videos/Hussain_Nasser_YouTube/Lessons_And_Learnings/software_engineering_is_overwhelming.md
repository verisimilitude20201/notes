# Software Engineerng is Overwhelming


## Learning a new technology:
   - Ask why this technology exists and what does it give you. 
   - This helps to understand the problem and derive principles from it.
   - For example: what problem does Kubernetes solve, what if I can choose an alternative? 
   - Asking these questions helps to isolate and understand the atomic/first principles inherent in that technoloy.
   - Kubernetes exists because we found a way to spin up an application in a jailed-process also called container which is completely isolated environment from other processes. To manage containers, we use Kubernetes. Few containers, we don't need Kubernetes.
   - Marketing gimmicks make software sound that it's the best and support all features. Understanding the first principles helps you choose the right tool, otherwise it's easy to get lost while learning.
   - Serverless word is a marketing term, the beautiful design is under-rated. 
   - Break up the compound concepts into it's fundamentals. Once we can do that, it'll be easy and not overwhelm the process of learning. You ask intriguing questions about the concept.
   - There can be first principle things that had never been invented. For example: Cloud flare built a layer-4 kernel level load balancer. These cannot be broken down.

## Bug fixing: 
   - Can be frustrating if you do not know the technology
   - First try to understand how things work. Stateless applications are difficult to debug, especially if you have some state.
   - Take a break if even after taking a long time you don't succeed in fixing the bug.

## Design Activities
   - Initial design that comes to mind may be the best you've come up with. If you look at it after sometime, you may look at it with a different perspective.
   - Present your design to your team, each engineer would give different perspectives on it, they would challenge your decisions.
   - Learn to ask why-why-why. 3-Why that'll support your every decision about the design.
